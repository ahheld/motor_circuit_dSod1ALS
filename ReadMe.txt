The following custom scripts were used to analyze data in the manuscript "Circuit dysfunction in SOD1-ALS model first detected in sensory feedback prior to motor neuron degeneration is alleviated by BMP signaling." These scripts were used to analyze data sets for larval behavior (Larval_locomotion), neuromuscular junction electrophysiology (NMJ_ephys), and patch electrophysiology (Patch_ephys). Data was frequently plotted in beeswarm plots generated by the beeswarmbar3 function.

These scripts make use of the glob function (Peter van den Biggelaar, https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40149-expand-wildcards-for-files-and-directory-names?focused=3775947&tab=function) and the abfload function (Harald Hentschke, https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6190-abfload). 

Questions regarding these scripts should be directed to Kristi Wharton (Kristi_Wharton@brown.edu) or Aaron Held (Aaron_Held@brown.edu).
